# what?
- This project *will be* developed on vscode and wsl with the kali-linux distro
- This project *will be* written in C
  - not Cpp, no!
  - it's pretty much the only language I'm good at
  - and I'm not bothering learning golang or other languages to do a pet project

- linux compatible
- > would be great if it's windows compatible too
- any step is good step

> This repository is public because it's not really something to hide
